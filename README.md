# odin-recipes
This is my first attempt at building a recipe page and should be an opportunity to use my HTML and CSS knowledge and who knows, I may even use the same project to apply JS knowledge further down the line. For now though, I will just be happy to practice the skills that I am learning.

I must also use this opportunity to get used to committing in the desired format, as this will help me to become more employable and easy to collaborate with in the future.

I think I may even use recipes that are inspired by my life outside of this project.

Enjoy!
