    <h2> Description</h2>

    <div id="main">

        <p>This dish is great on any occasion, it also works well on the BBQ! Just be 
            sure to glaze and baste it throughout cooking if you do. It's also a good idea 
            to start it off in the oven and then transfer it to the BBQ to ensure
             that it is properly cooked throughout, without burning it to heck. I like to eat it with rice, or if I'm feeling super jazzy, with ping
             rice! Personally, I like more sriracha and 
             usually chuck in some cayenne to give it a real kick. Adjust measurements to taste!
